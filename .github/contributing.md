# Your First Contribution
Don't worry everyone started exactly where you are,

* Unsure where to begin contributing to MoneyLog? You can start by looking through issues tagged with `good-first-issue`
* Help wanted issues - these are issues that may be a little more involved for a beginner but ultimately also a good foray into the codebase.

Working on your first Open Source contribution? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Before you get started
1. Fork the repo.
2. Work the [setup guide](/docs/setup.md)
3. Run the test suite `MIX_ENV=test mix test`. Please note we only accept pull requests with passing tests, and it awesome to make one pass.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without forking the repo.
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Inform `superbike_z` on the discord channel.

Bug reports can be filed using the issue template on this projects github repository, This format enables us to respond quicker and clearly to any bug reports.

## When filing an issue, make sure to answer these four questions:
 1. What version of MoneyLog are you using (mix: version)?
 2. What did you do?
 3. What did you expect to see?
 4. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement
Many of the features that MoneyLog has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work. We tend to prefer that our feature request and enhancements start as issues, formatted this way they make it very clear to the whole community what the aim of the request is and how it will change the work.


# Code review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in the discord channel. The meeting is announced in the weekly status updates that are sent on Monday mornings. 
After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community
You can chat with the core team on the discord channel linked above. We try to be available on all weekdays.
